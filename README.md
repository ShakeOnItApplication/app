In a more and more cashless society, making bets with friends is hard due to most people not holding any cash at the time of the bet. This leads to people saying they will get cash out later or send the money later through applications like Venmo. And this leads to friends eventually not paying up. 

With Shake On It, users can make bets with eachother and at the time of acceptance, the money is paid and placed in a pot beforehand. When the bet is over, the winner is decided and the total pot is sent to the winning users account.

The app is built with React, Redux, Thunk middleware, Node, and PostsgreSQL. 

The payments are all done through the Stripe API for now - eventually the goal will be to create easy transfers from all of the most popular services, cryptocurrencies, and banks.

My personal goal in developing Shake On It was to develop stronger development skills using React and Redux, and I will continue to clean the code base and implement best practices into the future.
